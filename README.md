# program-analysis

For now, this contains a simple implementation in Haskell of a data flow analysis engine that is capable of solving data flow constraints for arbitrary monotone frameworks using the worklist algorithm from Principles of Program Analysis. The code is probably quite inefficient in some places, since performance was not a focus while implementing this.
